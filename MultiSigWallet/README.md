# MultiSigWallet 
*(Smart Contract, Migration script and Test script for Truffle and Hardhat using Ganache as a local Blockchain network)*

The purpose of multisig wallets is to increase security by requiring multiple parties to agree on transactions before execution. Transactions can be executed only when confirmed by a predefined number of owners. You can submit a new transactions with a minimum of confirmations, and the adresses with permisions to confirm will have to confirm the transaction to be able to execute the transaction.
