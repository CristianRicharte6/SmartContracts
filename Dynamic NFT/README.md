# Dynamic NFTs using Chainlink

This is a Dynamic NFT project where the NFT can change with time. It has 3 stages:

- Car
- Sport Car
- Transformer

I am using Infura to upload the images and the metadata to IPFS. Following <a href="https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards">Metadata Standars from Open Sea</a>.

Also, I am subscribing to <a href="https://vrf.chain.link/">Chainlink VRF</a> to get a random number for the NFT mint.
