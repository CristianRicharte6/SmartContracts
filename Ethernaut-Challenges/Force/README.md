# Force Challenge (Send value to a contract with no Fallback and Receive)

![BigLevel7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102038261/199758351-8e80ca7b-61a3-45af-9b5c-ac59516c3c1b.svg)

<h3> Instructions from Ethernaut</h3>

<p>Some contracts will simply not take your money ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The goal of this level is to make the balance of the contract greater than zero.

Things that might help:

* Fallback methods
* Sometimes the best way to attack a contract is with another contract.
* See the Help page above, section "Beyond the console"</p>

<h3>To solve the challenge we need to... </h3>
<p> Create a secondary contract "Attacker.sol" and use the function "selfdestruct( )" to send the value it has to the address set.
This is the only way we can send value to a contract with no Fallback and Receive function.
